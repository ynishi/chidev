# chidev — pointers for coding agents

- What the project is and promises, and the crate layout: [README.md](README.md)
- Disclosure policy — read before anything ships:
  [PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT.md](PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Issue, branch, commit and PR conventions:
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Security reports: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- Decisions that outlive a change: `docs/adr/`
- API detail lives in RustDoc (`cargo doc`); code documentation outranks stale
  issue text.
- Never work on `main`; one branch per issue, cut from `origin/main` after a
  fetch. `just worktree-new <type> <slug>` from the main checkout does that and
  runs `just branch-check`.
- `just check` is green. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#verification) says
  what it covers.
- Review a change locally before it goes up — by a person or an AI agent — and
  say in the PR body who or what reviewed it.
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#working-with-coding-agents--the-recommended-pattern)
  lists the questions a review answers.
